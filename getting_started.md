## Example Usage

Here's a quick example of how you might use the ChatBox:

```
User: How do I create a new page in the documentation?
ChatBox: To create a new page in the documentation, you'll need to add a new Markdown file in the appropriate directory of your project. Here are the steps:

1. Navigate to the 'docs' folder in your project directory.
2. Create a new .md file with a descriptive name for your page.
3. Add the necessary frontmatter at the top of the file, including title and sidebar position.
4. Write your content using Markdown syntax.
5. Save the file and rebuild your documentation site.

For more detailed information, you can check our "Contributing to Documentation" guide.
