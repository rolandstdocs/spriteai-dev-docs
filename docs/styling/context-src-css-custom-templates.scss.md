# Custom Templates Styling

This file (`context-src-css-custom-templates.scss`) contains SCSS styles for custom templates used in the application. It provides a set of reusable styles and components that can be applied to various custom template elements.

## Usage

To use these styles, import this file into your main SCSS file:

```scss
@import 'custom-templates';
```

## Key Components

1. **Template Container**: Provides a base structure for custom templates.
2. **Header Styles**: Defines styles for template headers.
3. **Content Area**: Styles for the main content area of templates.
4. **Footer**: Styling for template footers.

## Customization

To customize these styles, you can override the variables defined at the top of the file. For example:

```scss
$template-background: #f5f5f5;
$header-color: #333333;
```

## Best Practices

1. Maintain a consistent naming convention for classes and variables.
2. Use SCSS features like nesting and mixins to keep your code DRY and maintainable.
3. Comment your code to explain complex selectors or styles.

## Important Notes

It is crucial to thoroughly test any changes across various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. Familiarity with SCSS and its advanced features such as variables, mixins, and nesting is recommended to fully leverage its capabilities in this context.
