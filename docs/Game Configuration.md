# Game Configuration

This document outlines the configuration options for setting up your game using the Phaser 3 framework.

## Overview

The game configuration is defined as a JavaScript object that is passed to the `Phaser.Game` constructor. This object specifies various settings that determine how your game will be initialized and run.

## Configuration Options

Here's an example of a basic game configuration:

```javascript
const config = {
    type: Phaser.AUTO,
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    parent: 'game',
    physics: {
        default: 'arcade',
        arcade: {
            gravity: { y: 0 },
            debug: false
        }
    },
    scene: MainScene
};

const game = new Phaser.Game(config);
```

Let's break down the key configuration options:

### Renderer Type

```javascript
type: Phaser.AUTO
```

This setting determines the rendering method. `Phaser.AUTO` allows Phaser to choose the best method based on the browser's capabilities. Other options include `Phaser.CANVAS` for canvas rendering and `Phaser.WEBGL` for WebGL rendering.

### Game Dimensions

```javascript
width: 800,
height: 600
```

These properties set the width and height of your game canvas in pixels.

### Parent Element

```javascript
parent: 'game'
```

This specifies the ID of the HTML element that will contain your game canvas. In this example, the game will be placed inside an element with the ID 'game'.

### Physics Configuration

```javascript
physics: {
    default: 'arcade',
    arcade: {
        gravity: { y: 0 },
        debug: false
    }
}
```

This section configures the physics engine for your game. In this example, we're using the 'arcade' physics system with no vertical gravity and debug mode turned off.

### Scene

```javascript
scene: MainScene
```

This property defines the initial scene (or scenes) to be loaded when the game starts. In this case, it's set to a scene called `MainScene`.

## Customization

You can customize these configuration options to suit your game's needs. For example, you might want to change the game dimensions, adjust the physics settings, or add multiple scenes.

Remember that this configuration is passed to the `Phaser.Game` constructor when initializing your game:

```javascript
const game = new Phaser.Game(config);
```

By modifying these settings, you can fine-tune your game's behavior and performance to create the best possible experience for your players.
