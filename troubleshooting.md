# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues you might encounter while using our developer tools and provides step-by-step solutions for each problem.

## Search Not Working

If you're experiencing issues with the search functionality, try the following steps:

1. **Check Orama Search Plugin Configuration**: Ensure that the `oramaSearchPlugin.js` file is properly configured in your project.

   ```javascript
   // In your docusaurus.config.js
   module.exports = {
     // ...other config
     plugins: [
       [
         path.resolve(__dirname, 'path/to/oramaSearchPlugin.js'),
         {
           // Any plugin options
         },
       ],
     ],
   };
   ```

2. **Verify Database Indexing**: Check if the Orama database is being properly indexed. Look for console logs indicating successful indexing:

   ```
   Content loaded. Database size: [number]
   Build completed. Indexed documents: [number]
   ```

   If you don't see these logs, there might be an issue with the `loadContent` function in `oramaSearchPlugin.js`.

3. **Inspect Browser Console**: Open your browser's developer tools and check the console for any error messages related to Orama search initialization.

4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes, cached data can interfere with search functionality. Clear your browser cache and reload the page.

5. **Check Network Requests**: In the browser's Network tab, look for any failed requests related to search functionality.

If the issue persists, review the `oramaSearchPlugin.js` file for any potential errors in the search implementation.

## ChatBox Not Responding

If the ChatBox component is not responding or not appearing, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify ChatBox Component Integration**: Ensure that the ChatBox component is properly imported and rendered in your React application.

   ```jsx
   import ChatBox from './path/to/ChatBox';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Other components */}
         <ChatBox messages={[]} onSendMessage={() => {}} />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Check Required Props**: Make sure you're passing the required props to the ChatBox component, including `messages` and `onSendMessage`.

3. **Inspect API Configuration**: Verify that the `chatUrl` in `chat.json` is correctly set to your chat API endpoint.

4. **Check Network Requests**: Use the browser's developer tools to inspect network requests when interacting with the ChatBox. Look for any failed API calls.

5. **Console Logging**: Add console.log statements in the ChatBox component, particularly in the `handleSendMessage` function, to track the flow of data and identify where the process might be failing.

6. **State Management**: Ensure that the `messages` state is being properly updated when new messages are sent or received.

If the ChatBox still doesn't respond, review the `ChatBox.jsx` file for any potential issues in the component logic or styling.

## Problems with Custom Components

If you're experiencing issues with custom components like CodeBlock or other UI elements:

1. **Import Verification**: Double-check that all custom components are properly imported in the files where they're used.

   ```jsx
   import CodeBlock from "../components/ui/codeblock";
   import { Button } from "../components/ui/button";
   ```

2. **Props Validation**: Ensure that you're passing the correct props to custom components. Review the component definitions for required props.

3. **Styling Issues**: If components are not displaying correctly, check that all necessary CSS files are imported and that there are no conflicts in styling.

4. **Component Rendering**: Verify that custom components are being rendered correctly within their parent components. Use React Developer Tools to inspect the component tree.

5. **Dependencies**: Make sure all required dependencies for custom components are installed and up-to-date in your project.

6. **Browser Compatibility**: Test the components in different browsers to identify any browser-specific issues.

If problems persist with specific custom components, review their implementation in the respective files (e.g., `src/components/ui/codeblock.js` for CodeBlock) and check for any recent changes that might have introduced bugs.

## General Troubleshooting Tips

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update your project dependencies to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features and bug fixes.
- **Check Console Logs**: Always monitor the browser console and server logs for error messages or warnings that might indicate the source of issues.
- **Review Recent Changes**: If a problem suddenly appears, review recent code changes or updates that might have introduced the issue.
- **Use Version Control**: Utilize Git or another version control system to easily revert changes if necessary and identify when issues were introduced.
- **Community Support**: Check the project's GitHub issues or community forums for similar problems and solutions reported by other developers.
