## Overview

The ChatBox interface is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with an AI-powered documentation assistant. It provides quick answers to your questions about the documentation and offers relevant source information.

## Opening the Chat Interface

To open the chat interface:

1. Look for a circular button with the logo in the corner of your screen.
2. Click on this button to open the chat interface.
3. The chat window will slide into view, displaying previous messages if any exist.

To close the chat interface, click on the "X" icon that replaces the logo button when the chat is open.

## Asking Questions

To ask a question:

1. Click on the input field at the bottom of the chat window.
2. Type your question or message.
3. Press Enter or click the send button (paper airplane icon) to submit your question.

Example:
```
How do I implement authentication in my app?
```

## Interpreting Responses

After submitting your question, you'll see:

1. Your message displayed in the chat window.
2. A loading indicator (three dots) while the AI processes your question.
3. The AI's response, which typically includes:
   - A direct answer to your question
   - References to relevant documentation
   - Source information for further reading

## Understanding Sources

At the end of each AI response, you'll find a "Sources" section. This provides links to the original documentation that the AI used to formulate its answer. 

Sources are displayed as badges and typically include:
- The name of the documentation file
- A link to the specific section in the documentation

Example:
```
Sources:
[Authentication Guide](/docs/authentication)
[Security Best Practices](/docs/security)
```

Click on these links to view the original documentation for more detailed information.

## Full-Screen Mode

For a better viewing experience, especially on smaller screens:

1. Look for the expand icon (four arrows pointing outward) in the top-right corner of the chat window.
2. Click this icon to enter full-screen mode.
3. To exit full-screen mode, click the "Close" button at the bottom of the full-screen chat window.

## Tips for Effective Use

1. Be specific in your questions to get more accurate answers.
2. Use keywords related to the documentation you're inquiring about.
3. If a response isn't clear, ask for clarification or rephrase your question.
4. Always check the provided sources for more comprehensive information.
5. Use full-screen mode on mobile devices for better readability.

Remember, the ChatBox is an AI assistant and should be used in conjunction with the full documentation for the best understanding of complex topics.
